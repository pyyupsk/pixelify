## How It Works

Pixelify uses advanced image processing algorithms to:

1. **Downscale** your image to create the pixelated effect
2. **Quantize** colors to match retro color palettes
3. **Apply dithering** for smooth color transitions (optional)
4. **Adjust** brightness, contrast, and saturation for the perfect look

All processing happens directly in your browser using HTML5 Canvas API, ensuring privacy and speed.

## Key Concepts

### Pixel Size

Controls how large each "pixel" in the output image will be. Larger values create a more pronounced pixelated effect.

- **Recommended range**: 4-16 for detailed images, 8-32 for bold, retro looks

### Color Depth

Determines how many colors are available in the final image:

- **8 colors**: Extreme retro, limited palette
- **16 colors**: Classic 16-bit style
- **32 colors**: Balanced retro look with good detail
- **256 colors**: Rich palette with subtle pixelation

### Dithering

A technique to create the illusion of more colors by mixing available colors:

- **None**: Clean, solid colors
- **Floyd-Steinberg**: Natural-looking gradients
- **Ordered (Bayer)**: Patterned, textured look
